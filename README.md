## About

You are all aware that SARA has made her appearance in the big family that is Epitech.

As a result, a new way to create your folders is to go through Github !

This is very nice, because lately Blih is a victim of Ddos, a real boomer.

So, I launched myself into the nothingness of programming, to offer you today a very practical script.

What does this script do ? This script will create you a private repository on Github with "ramassage-tsl" enabled and clone your repository in the place where the script is executed (Of course for the pickup, you must first have completed Nicolas' questionnaire, which consists of providing him with your nickname GitHub).

Nevertheless, it doesn't just do that, it will create your Blih repository with the functional "ramasage-tek".

We get to the essential point of this script, because in addition to creating your repository on Github as well as on Blih, it will initialize your freshly cloned repository with: a README.md and one .gitignore.

And to make it wonderful, it takes care of setting Blih, of `git add` the two files listed above, of `git commit`: [INIT REPOSITORY], before `git push` the whole thing on: `origin master`, as well as, `blih master`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to verify that `xdg-open` is on your machine, to do this you need to run this command:
``` shell
whereis xdg-open
```
After that, you need to set up your `github.user` with your Github username and your `github.email` with your [Github user id](https://caius.github.io/github_id/) (don't take '#') and ursename. To do that run this:
```shell
git config --global github.user <username>

git config --global github.email <id>+<username>@users.noreply.github.com
```
### Installing

To clone this project, write this command:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/s1mpleTEK/epitech-folder
```

## Usage
To create your repository you must then launch `run.sh`, in the right place for the creation of your repository. Example:
```shell
user:~/delivery/'Unix System Programming'/$>../../epitech-folder/./run.sh
```

### Tips
`run.sh` works as well alone out of the epitech-folder.
